### 3. Deploy to Zeabur

1.  **Commit and Push:** Initialize a Git repository, commit all three items (`server.js`, `package.json`, and the `/public` folder containing your images), and push them to a **new repository on GitHub**.
2.  **Connect Zeabur:** Follow the steps we outlined earlier:
    * Go to your Zeabur project.
    * Click **"Add Service"** > **"Deploy with Git"**.
    * Select the GitHub repository you just created.
3.  **Automatic Detection:** Zeabur will detect the `package.json` file, install `express`, run the `npm start` script (which runs `node server.js`), and deploy the service.
4.  **Final URL:** Once deployed, Zeabur assigns a public domain (e.g., `my-images.zeabur.app`). If you put `invite.png` in the `/public` folder, the link you use in your WhatsApp API calls will be:

    `https://my-images.zeabur.app/invite.png`

Do you have your images ready to go, or would you like to build a quick **React app** that consumes these image URLs once the server is deployed?
